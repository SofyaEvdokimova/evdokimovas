<p>Dancing in my underpants” aims to capture my thoughs,
feelings, reflections, longings, joys, and fanaberie
as per the never-ending feeling of not belonging.
Mainly, I've tried to capture the experience of being born
in Russia while not being Russian and growing up in Cyprus
as a non-Cypriot.</p>
<p>The main inspiration for the project was my journal; I've taken the cover and included some passages  from it in the photobook. There're some memorabilia that I force to be valuibe as well as some of my poetry and longings in words and images. All photographs were produced specifically for this project.</p>
